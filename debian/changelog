libhandy (0.0.4) experimental; urgency=medium

  [ Mohammed Sadiq ]
  * dialer-button: Fix emitting signal.
    As the properties where set to not explicitly fire ::notify, no
    signals where emitted. Let it be not explicit so that
    the signal will be emitted on change
  * ci: Enable code coverage.
    GitLab pages isn't supported now. So simply store the artifacts.
  * README: Add build and coverage status images
  * dialer: Handle delete button long press.
    Make the delete button clear the whole user input on long press

  [ Alexander Mikhaylenko ]
  * example: Remove sidebar border less aggressively.
    Applying the style to every element inside 'stacksidebar' also removes
    border from unrelated elements such as scrollbars. Hence only remove it
    from lists.

  [ Adrien Plazas ]
  * leaflet: Add the folded property.
    This is a boolean equivalent of the fold property, it is a needed
    convenience as is can be used in GtkBuilder declarations while the fold
    property is more convenient to use from C as it enables stronger typing.
  * example: Bind back and close buttons visibility to fold.
    Directly bind whether the back button and the close button are visible
    to whether the headerbar is folded.
  * Add HdyHeaderGroup
  * example: Use a HdyHeaderGroup.
    This automatically updates the headerbars' window decoration layout.
  * dialer-button: Replace digit and letters by symbols.
    Unify the digit and the letters of a dialer button as its symbols. This
    allows to make the code simpler by limiting the number of special cases.
    digit. This also handles Unicode characters.
  * dialer-cycle-button: Don't make the secondary label dim.
    This helps making it clear that these symbols are available, contrary to
    the dim ones from a regular dialer button.
  * dialer-button: Make the secondary label smaller.
    Makes the secondary text smaller to better match the mockups for Calls.
  * Add CSS names to the widgets
  * leaflet: Document the fold and folded properties
  * dialer: Set buttons checked instead setting relief.
    When digit keys are pressed, check the buttons state to checked rather
    than changing the relief.
  * dialer: Add the relief property.
    This allows to set the relief of the dialer buttons.
  * header-group: Drop forgotten log.
    This was accidentally left in.
    Fixes https://source.puri.sm/Librem5/libhandy/issues/47
  * example: Let the Column panel reach narrower widths.
    Readjust the column widget's margins and ellipsize its labels to let it
    reach narrower widths.
  * example: Separate the listbox items
  * example: Let the Dialer panel reach narrower widths.
    Put the dialer into a column rather than forcing its width to let it
    reach narrower widths.
  * example: Enlarge the dialer label.
    This makes the dialed number more readable.
  * example: Let the Welcome panel reach narrower widths.
    Let the welcome panel's labels wrap to let it reach narrower widths.
  * header-group: Sanitize the decoration layout.
    Checks whether the decoration layout is NULL, empty or has at least one
    colon.
    Fixes https://source.puri.sm/Librem5/libhandy/issues/44
  * header-group: Better handle references of header bars.
    Take a reference when adding a header bar, release them on destruction
    and don't take extra references on the focused child. This avoids using
    pointers to dead header bars or to leak them.
  * header-group: Fix the type of the focus property.
    This also fixes the types of the accessor functions.
    Fixes https://source.puri.sm/Librem5/libhandy/issues/46
  * header-group: Fix the docs of the focus property.
    This also improves the documentation of its accessor functions.
  * header-group: Guard the focused header bar setter.
    Better guard the focused header bar setter by checking that the set
    header bar actually is one and is part of the group.
  * meson: Require GTK+ 3.24.1 or newer.
    GTK+ 3.24.1 received style fixes required for HdyTitleBar to work as
    expected.

  [ Felix Pojtinger ]
  * docs: Format README to enable syntax highlighting.
    This also adds code fences and blanks around headers.

  [ Guido Günther ]
  * Depend on generated headers.
    If tests or examples are built early we want that hdy-enums.h is alread
    there.
  * docs: Add HdyFold.
    This makes sure it can be linked to by HdyLeaflet.
  * HdyLealflet: Use glib-mkenums.
    This makes the enums clickable in the HdyLeaflet documentation
    and makes the code smaller.
  * HdyFold: Use glib-mkenums.
    This makes the enums clickable in the HdyLeaflet documentation,
    HdyFold usable in GtkBuild and makes the code smaller.
  * HdyHeaderGroup: Document hdy_group_set_focus()
    This makes newer newer Gir scanner happy (and is a good thing anyway).
  * debian: Update shared library symbols
  * d/rules: Set a proper locale for the tests.
  * Check the debian package build during CI as well.
    This make sure we notice build breackage before it hits Jenkins to build
    the official debs.
  * ci: Fail on gtkdoc warnings.
    Gitlab seems to get confused by the '!' expression so use if instead.
  * tests: Test hdy_header_group_{get,set}_focus
  * HdyDialer: Apply 'keypad' style class.
    This applies the 'keypad' style class to both the keypad itself and its
    buttons. This allows to style the buttons and the keypad in the
    application.
  * glade: Verify catalog data via xmllint
  * debian: Add dependenies for running xmllint.
    This also makes sure we have it available during CI
  * HdyHeaderGroup: Allow to get and remove the headerbars
  * debian: Add new symbols
  * glade: Add a module so we can handle HdyHeaderGroup
  * run: Add glade lib to LD_LIBRARY_PATH.
    This makes it simple to test the built version.
  * Move glade catalog from data/ to glade/
    Given that there will be more complex widgets lets keep the catalog
    and module together.
  * glade: Use a custom DTD.
    Glades DTD is not up to date. Use a custom copy until this is fixed
    upstream:
        https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/glade/merge_requests/11
    We do this as a separate commit so we can revert it once upstream glade is
    fixed.
  * glade: Support HdyHeaderGroup (Closes: #38)
  * debian: Ship glade module

libhandy (0.0.3) experimental; urgency=medium

  [ Adrien Plazas ]
  * New HdyTitleBar widget. This coupled with a transparent headerbar
    background can work around graphical glitches when animation header bars
    in a leaflet.
  * column: Add the linear-growth-width property
  * glade: Fix the generic name of HdyArrows
  * flatpak: Switch the runtime of the example to master.
  * column: Add a missing break statement.
  * leaflet: Hide children on transition end only when folded.
  * leaflet: Init mode transition positions to the final values.
  * example: Always show a close button.
  * example: Load custom style from CSS resource
  * example: Draw the right color for sidebar separators.
  * example: Use separators to separate the panels.
  * leaflet: Start the child transition only when folded.

  [ Christopher Davis ]

libhandy (0.0.1) experimental; urgency=medium

  [ Guido Günther ]
  * Release 0.0.1

  [ Adrien Plazas ]
  * Add HdyColumn widget

 -- Guido Günther <agx@sigxcpu.org>  Sat, 09 Jun 2018 09:12:06 +0200

libhandy (0.0~git20180517) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Add an arrows widget.
    The widget prints a number of arrows one by one to indicate a sliding
    direction. Number of arrows and animation duration are configurable.
  * Add symbols file

 -- Guido Günther <agx@sigxcpu.org>  Thu, 17 May 2018 15:51:01 +0200

libhandy (0.0~git20180429) unstable; urgency=medium

  [ Guido Günther ]
  * New git snapshot
  * HdyDialer: Emit symbol-clicked signal.  This signal is emitted when a
    symbol button (numbers or '#' or '*') is clicked.
  * HdyDialer: Emit signal when delete button was clicked.
  * dialer: Make it simple to clear the stored number.
    This also makes sure we don't send multiple number changed events
    when nothing changed.
  * dialer: Delay number notify.  On button press send out the number changed
    signal at the very end so listeners can process the button event prior to
    the number update event.

  [ Adrien Plazas ]
  * leaflet: Refactor homogeneity.
    This makes factorizes the homogeneity functions of HdyLeaflet to make
    the code a bit shorter.
  * build: Add '--c-include=handy.h' GIR options back.
    This is necessary for introspection to know the header file to use.
  * dialer: Check params of the 'number' prop accessors.
    Sanitize the parameters of the 'number' property accessor. This will
    warn or misusages of the API at runtime and avoid potential crashes.
  * dialer: Style cleanup of the 'number' prop accessors.
    Use gchar instead of char, use GNOME style pointer spacing and name the
    number parameter 'number'. This is all cosmetic but will make the code
    look a bit more GNOME-like.
  * example: Drop hardcoded default window size.
    This avoid overridding with the one we set in the the .ui file of the
    window.
  * example: Move window title to .ui file.
    This avoid hardcoding values when we can put them in the UI description.
  * example-window: Make the default size more phone-like

  [ Bob Ham ]
  * dialer: Add "show-action-buttons" property.
    Add a new boolean "show-action-buttons" property that specifies
    whether the submit and delete buttons are displayed.
