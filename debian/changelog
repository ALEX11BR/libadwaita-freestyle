  [ Guido G端nther ]
  * New git snapshot
  * HdyDialer: Emit symbol-clicked signal.  This signal is emitted when a
    symbol button (numbers or '#' or '*') is clicked.
  * HdyDialer: Emit signal when delete button was clicked.
  * dialer: Make it simple to clear the stored number.
    This also makes sure we don't send multiple number changed events
    when nothing changed.
  * dialer: Delay number notify.  On button press send out the number changed
    signal at the very end so listeners can process the button event prior to
    the number update event.

  [ Adrien Plazas ]
  * leaflet: Refactor homogeneity.
    This makes factorizes the homogeneity functions of HdyLeaflet to make
    the code a bit shorter.
  * build: Add '--c-include=handy.h' GIR options back.
    This is necessary for introspection to know the header file to use.
  * dialer: Check params of the 'number' prop accessors.
    Sanitize the parameters of the 'number' property accessor. This will
    warn or misusages of the API at runtime and avoid potential crashes.
  * dialer: Style cleanup of the 'number' prop accessors.
    Use gchar instead of char, use GNOME style pointer spacing and name the
    number parameter 'number'. This is all cosmetic but will make the code
    look a bit more GNOME-like.
  * example: Drop hardcoded default window size.
    This avoid overridding with the one we set in the the .ui file of the
    window.
  * example: Move window title to .ui file.
    This avoid hardcoding values when we can put them in the UI description.
  * example-window: Make the default size more phone-like

  [ Bob Ham ]
  * dialer: Add "show-action-buttons" property.
    Add a new boolean "show-action-buttons" property that specifies
    whether the submit and delete buttons are displayed.
